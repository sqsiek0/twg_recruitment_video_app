This is my recruitment project for The Widlarz Group, showcasing a video presentation app that I developed. Below, I’ll document the challenges I encountered and the solutions I implemented.

## First Impressions with Expo and React Native

I didn’t expect it to work this seamlessly. This is my first time working with tools like these, and I’m genuinely impressed that I can launch the app on my phone just by scanning a QR code. The speed at which changes are applied is remarkable, and I’m pleasantly surprised by how responsive everything feels. I’m excited to see what else will amaze me.
